    "- **FACETS**: Fraction and Allele-Specific Copy Number Estimates from Tumor Sequencing\n",
    "- **high-throughput DNA sequencing**:  formerly \"next-generation\" DNA sequencing.\n",
    "- **NGS data**: Next-generation sequencing data\n",
    "- **ASCN**: allele-specific copy number\n",
    "- **homo/heter-zygous**: Most eukaryotes have two matching sets of chromosomes; that is, they are diploid. Diploid organisms have the same loci on each of their two sets of homologous chromosomes, except that the sequences at these loci may differ between the two chromosomes in a matching pair and that a few chromosomes may be mismatched as part of a chromosomal sex-determination system. If both alleles of a diploid organism are the same, the organism is homozygous at that locus. If they are different, the organism is heterozygous at that locus. If one allele is missing, it is hemizygous, and, if both alleles are missing, it is nullizygous.\n",
    "- **BAM file**: A BAM file (.bam) is the binary version of a SAM file.  A SAM file (.sam) is a tab-delimited text file that contains sequence alignment data.   These formats are described on the SAM Tools web site: http://samtools.sourceforge.net. \n",
    "- **exome**: The exome is the part of the genome formed by exons, the sequences which when transcribed remain within the mature RNA after introns are removed by RNA splicing.\n",
    "- **SNP**: A single-nucleotide polymorphism, often abbreviated to SNP (pronounced snip; plural snips), is a variation in a single nucleotide that occurs at a specific position in the genome, where each variation is present to some appreciable degree within a population (e.g. > 1%).\n",
