This simulation study shows that with a reasonable prior for the missing
mechanism, imputing missing values with a logistic link on Bernoulli
probabilities for data that is a mixture of Normals should approximate the
observed data well, and impute the data in a consistent way.

If no mixtures are observed in the high-missing region, but the underlying true
pattern for the high-missing region is a mixture, a mixture will not be captured.
The missing mechanism greatly influences the imputed missing values.

For our application, probably not too essential.
