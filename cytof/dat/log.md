Looked at the `ALL.csv` file and `CB34_CLEAN.csv` files (among others).

`ALL.csv` contains 45 binary columns for the markers. The names are similar
to that in `CB34_CLEAN.csv` but not exactly the same. The number of columns
in the latter file is also different (34). According to Li Li, the discrepancy
is possibly due to a difference in machinery (which did the analyses). More 
clarification is needed to do the analysis.

Also, what are the rows supposed to represent?

The log of the columns in `CB34_CLEAN.csv` appear to be Normal.
