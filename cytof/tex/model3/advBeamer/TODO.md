# Suggestions

- [x] I may have one full slide to discuss why doctors are interested in studying NK cells.  
- [x] I may have one (or more) full slide to discuss feature allocation model including IBP. 
-  Instead of tables, I may use some plots of kernel density estimate of y_{inj} with proportions of missing values. 
- [x] slide 4: It is not clear what you want to talk there. 
- [ ] slide 5: may list names of existing methods.  how about missing values? Does any of existing methods take care of that?
- [x] slides 17-18 & 20-21: seems redundant.  you may say similar results are obtained for samples 2 and 3.
- [x] Rather I move some of your backup slides like predictive distributions and histogram of q and missing mechanism posterior. 
- [x] slides 24-26: I may summarize and include in slide 23.  Keep slides 24-26 as backup slides.
- [x] slide 32: Excellent! 
- [x] For repFAM, I may make some dummy Z matrices to illustrate difference between IBP and repFAM.
- [ ] slide 36: way too much. summarize what you want to do in the beginning in plain words.  may consider having more than one slides 
- [x] slide 41: have a more than what you have now.  It looks like there is no plan.  
- [x] one minor:  may have a slide to include posterior computation and posterior summary for project 1 since you show point estimates of Z and w, but the method of finding the point estimates are  not discussed.  may not want to spend a lot of time on it, but want to explain that.

# TODO Before Advancement
- Project 1
    - [ ] `pp_obs_ij.pdf` get credible intervals
    - [ ] CB missing mechanism posterior and qij hist for random beta (send to Juhee)
    - [ ] Redo simulation for N=10000
    - [ ] Show TWO simulations studies using FlowSOM and FAM
        - [ ] one where results are same (I already have this)
        - [ ] one where results are very different
- Project 2
    - [ ] Redo sim-study
        - [ ] use different sig / w / mu
        - [ ] Show when results are different
- [ ] Send slides to Juhee


# TODO After Advancement
- Project 1
    - [ ] Constrained priors for beta and sigma
