# TODO Before Advancement
- Project 1
    - [ ] `pp_obs_ij.pdf` get credible intervals
    - [ ] CB missing mechanism posterior and qij hist for random beta (send to Juhee)
    - [ ] Redo simulation for N=10000
    - [ ] Show TWO simulations studies using FlowSOM and FAM
        - [ ] one where results are same (I already have this)
        - [ ] one where results are very different
- Project 2
    - [ ] Redo sim-study
        - [ ] use different sig / w / mu
        - [ ] Show when results are different
- [ ] Send slides to Juhee


# TODO After Advancement
- Project 1
    - [ ] Constrained priors for beta and sigma
