The model can generally recover $Z$ when good starting values are provided for
$Z$, and for $Z$ matrices of varying complexity when $K$ is fixed at a value
greater than or equal to the truth. When $K$ is fixed at a smaller value,
columns in $Z$ may either be omitted or aggregated. Log-computation time
increases with log K.  When $K$ is recovered, $W$ and $\mu^*$ can be recovered.
In cases where no observations are associated with a particular $\mu^*_{zij}$,
that parameter is sampled from the prior.
