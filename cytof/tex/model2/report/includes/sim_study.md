In order to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed model,
two simulation studies were conducted. The studies generate data that resemble
the CB CYTOF data. Parameters of greatest interest including $Z, \mu^*,$ and $W$
are studied, and the studies are done for different but fixed values for the
dimensions of the feature allocation model.
