In order to understand the strengths and limitations of the proposed model,
two simulation studies were conducted. The studies generate data that resemble
the CB CYTOF data. Parameters of greatest interest including $Z, \mu^*,$ and $W$
are studied, and the studies are done for different but fixed values for the
dimensions of the feature allocation model.

[comment]: <> (% TODO
We may want to have just sections for simulation studies without subsections,
that is, Section 4.1 for Simulation study 1 and Section 4.2 for Simulation
study 2 in Section 4 Simulation Studies.
For each section, we include 
  - data generation (that you already have in your section 4.1. But, make them specific for each simulation study)
  - fitting the model for the simulated data such as fixed hyperparameters and
specifics about MCMC
  - results inference
- [ ] As I write later, we include how we specified the fixed hyperparameters and explain why. We also explain how we specify the starting values of the random parameters in "(2) fitting the model for the simulated data."
- [ ] We haven’t explained our specific datasets like CB CYTOF data. We don’t know the details of CB data. You may write some short paragraph. We will ask Katy to write some paragraphs about the datasets later.
