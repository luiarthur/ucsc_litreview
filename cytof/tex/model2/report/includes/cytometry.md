Data for this project is rendered through CyTOF analyses of NK-cell-targeting
markers. Having some understanding of CyTOF and NK cells their importance is
therefore necessary.

Flow cytometry (developed by Wallace Coulter in the 1950's) is a laser-based
biophysical technology for biomarker detection, among other things.

In the end, what does it
measure? In other words, what do we have in data? We have real values.
What do they mean?

It is regularly used to diagnose health disorders like cancer. Cytometry has
advanced over the years. Fluorescence-based flow cytometry, which makes use of
fluorescent dyes and lasers that emit light at specific wavelengths, is one
such advancement that has been mainstream for several decades. In recent years,
a new technique called Cytometry at time-of-flight (CyTOF) has surfaced. It
makes use of time-of-flight mass spectrometry, where sophisticated devices are
used to accelerate, separate, and identify ions by mass. This new method
warrants the analysis of multiple parameters in shorter time.  Through CyTOF,
scientists have been able to better understand natural killer (NK) cells
[@horowitz2013genetic]. NK cells play critical roles in defending against
tumors. Furthermore, their diversity and function are known to be linked.
Researchers have thus studied NK cell diversity from various perspectives.  For
instance, it is known that NK cell diversity is lower at birth
[@strauss2015human] than in adults. Some researchers have studied the effect of
introducing diverse NK cells into tumor patients. Yet again, some researchers
have found that patients with higher NK diversity are associated with higher
exposure risk of HIV-1, suggesting that existing diversity may decrease
flexibility of the antiviral response. Many questions about NK cells remain to
be answered. Understanding NK diversity through spectrometry has therefore been
an important research area in the bio-sciences.

<!-- TODO
very nice paragraph! but we need to
explain the existing statistical methods for cytof data and why the existing
methods are not enough for our purpose.
We may shorten the following subsections on IBP and move them to the next
section “Probability Model”.
