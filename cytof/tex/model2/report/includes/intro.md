Advances in cytometry has led to more research and greater understanding of
natural killer (NK) cells and how their diversity impacts immunity against the
development of tumors and other viral diseases.  The main inferential goal of
this project is to identify the NK cell phenotypes (or cell-types) in various
samples as a set of subpopulations of the set of some provided surface markers.
The NK cell-types are latent, and for $J$ markers $2^J$ different cell-types
can be considered. This provides a computational challenge when the number of
markers is even moderately large.  Thirty-two markers are included in this
analysis, and naively enumerating all possible markers is not feasible. We
therefore, use a latent feature allocation model to learn the latent structure
of predominant cell-types. Latent feature models have been successfully applied
to various problems and will be reviewed in section 2.2.
