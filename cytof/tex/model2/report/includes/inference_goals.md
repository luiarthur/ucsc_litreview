The main inferential goal of this project is to identify the NK cell phenotypes
(or cell-types) in various samples as a set of subpopulations of the set of
some provided surface markers. The NK cell-types are latent, and for $J$
markers $2^J$ different cell-types can be considered. This provides a
computational challenge when the number of markers is even moderately large.
Thirty-two markers are included in this analysis, and naively enumerating all
possible markers is not feasible. We therefore, use a latent feature allocation
model to learn the latent structure of predominant cell-types. We will review
this type of model in section 2.2.
