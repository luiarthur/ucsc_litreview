Since the full conditional distribution cannot be directly sampled from, it may
be sampled from by a Metropolis step with a Normal proposal distribution. 
The proposed state is accepted with probability

\newcommand{\mhLogSpiel}[2]{
Since the full conditional distribution for $#1$ cannot be directly sampled
from, it may be sampled from by a Metropolis step with a Normal proposal
distribution.  The parameter first needs to be log-transformed.  
Let the full conditional of the transformed parameter be 
$p(#2 \mid \y, \rest) = p_{#1}(\exp(#2) \mid \y, \rest) \exp(#2)$.
Then, the proposed state of the transformed parameter ($#2$) is accepted with
probability
$$
\min\bc{1, 
  \frac{p(\tilde #2  \mid \y, \rest)}
       {p(#2 \mid \y, \rest)}
}.
$$
Exponentiating the updated value for $#2$ returns the updated value for $#1$.

Since the full conditional distribution for $#1$ cannot be directly sampled
from, it may be sampled from by a Metropolis step with a Normal proposal
distribution.  The parameter first needs to be logit-transformed. 
Let the full conditional of the transformed parameter be 
$p(#2 \mid \y, \rest) = p_{#1}\p{\frac{1}{1+\exp(-#2)} \mid \y, \rest} 
\frac{\exp(-#2)}{(1 + \exp(- #2))^2}$.

Taking the inverse-logit of the updated value for $#2$ returns the updated
value for $#1$.
