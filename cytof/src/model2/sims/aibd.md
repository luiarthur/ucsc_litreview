# Should I do AIBD?

## What Makes Sense

- I can come up with a proposal for AIBD
- I have experience
- There's now a compelling application
- Might be quicker to finish dissertation

## What Doesn't Make Sense

- The DIBP may be more natrual.
- I don't think the pmf should be a huge focus, but the process and the
  underlying motivation. We can do gibbs and metropolis without the pmf for the
  actual process. Are there any computational advantages to having an explicit
  pmf? This may be the determining factor.
