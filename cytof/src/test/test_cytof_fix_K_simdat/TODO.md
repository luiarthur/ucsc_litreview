# Next To Try:

### Now 
- [ ] Compute loglike every 100 steps ?
- [X] use: N = (20000, 30000, 10000)
- [ ] Use Juhee's way to get point estimate (Not urgent)
- [ ] large N -> large `cs_v`, `cs_h` (tune)
- [ ] autotune `cs_v`, `cs_h`?
- [X] Use a (true) Z with markers appearing in multiple cell types
    - i.e. each rowsum(Z) is not necessarily 1.
- [ ] Mis-specify K => what happens? 
    - Try true K=4, but fix K = {1,2,3, 5,6,7}
- [ ] Plotting for mus?

### Eventually 
- [ ] Model K


## 1 Oct, 2017
- [x] high cs_v and/or cs_h, but cs_psi = .01 as before.
