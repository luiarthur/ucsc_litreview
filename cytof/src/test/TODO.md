# TO DO

## 14 August 2017 (Juhee's email)

1. Since data is generated at random, we donâ€™t expect that we always recover
   the truth.  So if we recover the truth on average, it is great.

2. Can we scale up?  K=4 seems fine.  We may increase the number of markers
   (larger J), # of samples (larger I) and  # of cells (larger $N_i$).

3. See what the posterior is like when K is misspecified like K=1, 2, 3, 5,
   6....  We may compute log-likelihood for each K and see how it changes over
   different values of K.

4. We may keep Z as it is now. One marker is in one phenotype and phenotypes
   have the same number of markers.  Later we may explore a bit.  Say, some
   markers belong to more than one phenotype.  Some phenotypes have fewer
   markers.
